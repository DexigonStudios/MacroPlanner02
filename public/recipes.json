Add the onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds longer or until fragrant.\n\nAdd the carrots and mushrooms, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, stir to blend, and cook for a minute longer.\n\nAdd the canned tomatoes, parsley, and basil. Mash and stir the tomatoes with a potato masher until the sauce starts to thicken, about 5 minutes over medium-high heat.\n\nReduce the heat to low and simmer gently while preparing meatballs, stirring occasionally.@Form the meatballs:\nIn a large bowl, use your hands to mix the beef, Italian sausage, basil, parsley, mushrooms, eggs, breadcrumbs, cheese, salt, and pepper. Do not over-mix or the meatballs will be tough.\n\nUse a small melon baller, cookie scoop, or heaping teaspoon to form 1-inch round meatballs.

When the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot.\n\nLeave the pot uncovered while you cook the pasta on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put a timer on for 8 to 10 minutes, or according to package directions for al dente pasta (cooked but still a little firm).
